SER 2011 B: Hexagram
===============

A Hexagram is a 6-pointed star, sometimes called the Star of David.

Given 12 distinct numbers, in how many ways, disregarding rotations and 
reflections, can you assign the numbers to the vertices such that the sum of the 
numbers along each of 6 straight lines passing through 4 vertices is the same?


The Input
---------
There will be several test cases in the input. Each test case will consist of twelve 
unique positive integers on a single line, with single spaces separating them. All 
of the numbers will be less than 1,000,000.  The  input will end with  a line with 
twelve 0s.

The Output
----------
For each test case, output the number of ways the numbers can be assigned to 
vertices such that the sum along each line of the hexagram  is the same. Put 
each answer on its own line. Output no extra spaces, and do not separate 
answers with blank lines.
